# Languages for Roguelike Dungeons -- Fnar's Edition

A Language pack focused on increasing supported languages for items generated by the [Roguelike Dungeons -- Fnar's Edition](https://github.com/fnar/minecraft-roguelike) mod.  

Minecraft Vanilla 1.12.2 clients will only see the items' Name translated, and their Lore will remain in English, because of Minecraft's limitations.  
Modded clients with RLD -- Fnar's Edition will benefit seeing its item's Lore translated as well.  

AFAIK, Minecraft 1.13 and later support translatable Lore as well.  
When Fnar finishes RLD for newer Minecraft versions, I'll publish their corresponding Resource Pack.
